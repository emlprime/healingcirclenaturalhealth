			<h4>Herbs</h4>
			Formulated pre-made or custom made herbals. If I make the formulas for you, they can take up to two weeks. Price varies depending on whether    the herb is pre-made or handmade by Kathy.</li>
		  <li>
			<h4>Homeopathics</h4>
			Homeopathy is based on the principle that like cures like. The    substance to be used in healing is placed on a small sugar ball or lactose    tablet which is then dissolved in the mouth. Homeopathics contain the "medicine" in such a small dose that it isn’t even chemically present    anymore. It works on a cellular level. Price varies, but is usually around $10</li>

It heals on all levels of body,    mind and spirit and is great for stress, grief, emotional changes and    physical pain and discomfort. $85/session. Classes are also available.</li>
